  <p>Tables are a structured way of presenting large volumes of data in a manner that makes the data readable and comparable.</p>
  <div class="lists-unordered">
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Content alignment:</strong> Content should be left aligned except when using a different alignment option helps with comprehension. For example, numeric data is easier to scan when right aligned. The alignment of column headers matches their content.</li>
      <li><strong>Columns and rows:</strong> The number and type of columns that you choose should be based on the information needs for the majority of the use cases. To help users read tables, order the columns by importance from left to right.</li>
    </ul>
